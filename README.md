## WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES
* Helps with calculations of finance!
* *This is achieved in any of the following ways*
	* **bond calculation**
	* **investment calculation**

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
In a basic summary, the program works by
1. presenting the user with the choice for bond or investment.
2. Inputs are collected and the necessary output is calculated.

## DETAILED SUMMARY
### How is this done?
 See the below formulae

### How bond is calculated

    Bond repayment formula:
        The amount that a person will have to be repaid on a home loan each
        month is calculated as follows: repayment = x = (i.P)/(1 - (1+i)^(-n))
        In the formulae above:
        ● ‘P’ is the present value of the house

### How investment is calculated

    Interest formula:
        The total amount when simple interest is applied is calculated as
        follows: A = P(1 + r * t)
        The Python equivalent is very similar: A =P*(1+r*t)
        The total amount when compound interest is applied is calculated as
        follows: A = P(1 + r) ^ t
        The Python equivalent is slightly different: A = P* math.pow((1+r),t)
        In the formulae above:
        ● ‘r’ is the interest entered above divided by 100, e.g. if 8% is entered,
        then r is 0.08.
        ● ‘P’ is the amount that the user deposits.
        ● ‘t’ is the number of years that the money is being invested for.
        ● ‘A’ is the total amount once the interest has been applied.
